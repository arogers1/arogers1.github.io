## Yet Another Blog

My name is Adam Rogers. I recognize the internet world is flooded beyond comprehension with blogs, vlogs, and the likes, and that the chances of me having anything to say that hasn't already been said are very small. And so my purpose for starting a blog is selfish: writing my thoughts will be an effective way to formalize my learning and keep myself accountable.

## About Me

Just in case anyone does read this, here's a little introduction. I'm a software developer / machine learning engineer who just recently accepted an offer on Microsoft's Analysis and Experimentation team as a software development engineer. I'm leaving a great startup in Lehi, Utah called Jane.com. If you're a woman you might know that name; if you're a man you probably won't - our customer base is 98% female, as we sell mainly women's boutique fashion items. 

I was in charge of machine learning and especially personalization algorithms at Jane. As such, and as these are topics that I'm passionate about, these topics will probably dominate this blog, along with the things I learn and work on going forward at Microsoft.

I'm really excited to work for the Analysis and Experimentation team at Microsoft. The team is pretty small but packed with highly credentialed, experienced, and accomplished engineers and data scientists. Needless to say I'll have my work cut out for me to keep up with the team, but I'm excited for the challenge and for everything I'm going to learn. I'd recommend you check out their site; they do some pretty impressive stuff: http://www.exp-platform.com/Pages/default.aspx

## Goals of this Blog

Like I said, this blog is really for me - it may as well be a personal journal except I'd like to have it as a portfolio of sorts to show my learning and accomplishments. Anyway, here are my goals for this blog:

1. Formalize my learning in the fields of software engineering, machine learning, and data science. They say you don't really know something until you can explain it clearly to others, so I'll use this blog to explain what I have learned and will learn.
2. Have a convenient portfolio to link to in order to display my learning, projects and accomplishments in my field.
3. Push myself to keep learning and growing in my career and interests. Having a blog visible to the world (even if no one actually reads it) makes me publicly accountable to keep learning and writing. I want to become an expert in my field, and this is a way of keeping myself accountable to my goals.

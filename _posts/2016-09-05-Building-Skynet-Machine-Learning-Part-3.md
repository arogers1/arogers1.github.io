# Machine Learning Part 3

In the previous 2 parts of our 3 part machine learning post we talked informally about some machine learning theory - what machine learning is, its relationship to pattern recognition, when it can be used, etc. This post will cover the different types of machine learning and in what situations to use them. We'll be talking about supervised vs. unsupervised learning, which refer to whether or not you have any labels or "right answers" in your dataset, and regression vs. classification, which refer to what type of variable your machine learning model is trying to predict.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Think back to your high school Biology class, sitting in the classroom with the teacher up at the board drilling into your head basic human anatomy. This is the femur, this is the tibia, this is the fibula (why did they have to make those names so similar?), and so on. She tells you there will be a quiz on the names of the leg bones the next day, so you create flash cards with pictures of leg bones on one side and their names on the other side. You study hard, at first getting the answers wrong when you review your flash cards but gradually getting better and better at identifying the correct names for the bones, and the next day you ace your quiz. You have just successfully performed *supervised learning*. You had input observations (the picture side of the flash cards) and along with them, you had the correct *labels* (the name side of the flash cards).
